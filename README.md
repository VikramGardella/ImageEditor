# ImageEditor
Old Java project from Sophomore year of high school. (5-18-2012)

If I recall correctly, this was for the final project of MSTC Computer Science 2 and we had to make a full-stack replica of "Adobe Photoshop" from scratch. We made the GUI using all of Java's "JFrame" library and then we edited an image by treating it as a 2-Dimensional array of pixels, where each pixel was a quadruple of double-digit hex values [0-255] (ie. "0033CCFF" = 00 for the alpha value, 33 = red, CC = green, FF = blue).
